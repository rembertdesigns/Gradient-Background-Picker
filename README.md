## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Animation Types
```javascript
// In main.js, extend the animation system
updateAnimation() {
    // Add your custom animation logic here
    if (this.animationType === 'your-animation') {
        // Custom animation implementation
    }
}
```
### Custom Color Presets
```javascript
// Add to the presets array in loadPresets()
const customPresets = [
    { name: 'Your Brand', gradient: 'linear-gradient(45deg, #yourcolor1, #yourcolor2)' },
    // Add more presets
];
```
### Theming
Modify CSS custom properties in `style.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #667eea;
    --secondary-color: #764ba2;
    --background-blur: 10px;
    /* Customize colors and effects */
}
```

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Animations aren't working on my browser**
A: Animations use CSS transforms and may have limited support on older browsers. Try updating your browser or disabling hardware acceleration if you experience performance issues.

**Q: Eyedropper tool says "not supported"**
A: The EyeDropper API is currently supported in Chrome/Edge 95+. Firefox and Safari support is coming soon. You can still manually enter color values.

**Q: My gradients look different when exported**
A: Some complex gradients with many color stops might render differently across browsers. Test your exported CSS in your target browsers for consistency.

**Q: Local storage data is gone**
A: Favorites and collections are stored in browser local storage. Clear browser data or incognito mode will reset these. Use the export feature to backup your gradients.

**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**
A: Yes! This project is MIT licensed, so you can use generated gradients in any project, commercial or personal.

### Performance Tips
- Limit animations on mobile devices for better battery life
- Use fewer color stops for smoother gradients
- Export static CSS for production instead of keeping animations
